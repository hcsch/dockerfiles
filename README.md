# Dockerfiles
This is a repository with a collection of some Dockerfiles I personally use for a variety of purposes.

They are licensed under CC0 1.0 (see `LICENSE` file),
so you are free to use them as you please.
You don't have to attribute me, but I wouldn't mind if you did either.

## Building an image
To build the images described by ony of my Dockerfiles simply run
```bash
docker build .
```
in it's directory.
